Iceberg Chart Explainer
Welcome to the Iceberg Chart Explainer, a powerful, self-hosted alternative to websites like icebergcharts.com. This application allows you to create, manage, and explore your own iceberg charts, with explanations for every entry dynamically generated by Google's state-of-the-art AI.

This platform is built for communities, content creators, and enthusiasts who want a dedicated space to build and share deep dives into any topic imaginable.

✨ Features
Self-Hosted & Your Data: You have full control over your data, hosted on your own free Supabase instance.

AI-Powered Explanations: Uses Google's Gemma models via the AI Studio API and Google Custom Search to provide rich, context-aware explanations for any iceberg entry.

Intelligent Homepage:

AI Categorization: Automatically groups your iceberg charts into topics (e.g., "Gaming," "Media," "History") for easy navigation. This is a one-time process you can run, ensuring a fast user experience.

AI Recommendations: A powerful search bar that uses AI to analyze a user's query and recommend the most relevant iceberg charts.

Full CRUD Management: A user-friendly web interface to Create, Read, Update, and Delete charts, layers, and entries without ever touching the database directly.

Smart Image Handling:

Image Proxy: Bypasses hotlink protection from external sites, ensuring images are always displayed correctly.

Image Refresh: A simple button allows users to fetch a new image if the first one isn't suitable.

Efficient & Fast:

Client-Side Caching: Explanations are cached in the user's browser session, minimizing redundant API calls and speeding up navigation.

Easy Deployment: Designed for simple, one-click deployment on platforms like Vercel.

🚀 Full Setup & Deployment Guide
Follow these steps to get your own instance of the Iceberg Chart Explainer running.

Step 1: Prerequisites
A Supabase account (free tier is sufficient).

A Google Cloud account for API keys.

Python 3.8+ and pip installed on your local machine.

Git installed on your local machine.

Step 2: Supabase Setup
Create a Supabase Project: Go to your Supabase dashboard and create a new project.

Get API Credentials: In your new project, navigate to Project Settings > API. Keep this page open, as you will need the Project URL and the anon public key.

Run the SQL Schema: Go to the SQL Editor, paste the entire content of the supabase_schema.sql file from this repository, and click Run. This will create all the necessary tables and policies.

Step 3: Google API Setup
Google AI Studio API Key:

Go to Google AI Studio.

Create a new API key and copy it.

Google Custom Search API Key & Engine ID:

Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project.

Enable the Custom Search API.

Go to the Credentials page and create a new API Key. Copy this key.

Go to the Programmable Search Engine page.

Create a new search engine. In the setup, select the option to Search the entire web.

Once created, find and copy the Search engine ID.

Crucially, make sure the Image search toggle is turned ON in your search engine's settings.

Step 4: Local Project Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd iceberg-explainer

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv
# Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Environment Variables:

Create a file named .env in the root of the project.

Copy the contents of .env.example (if provided) or add the following, filling in your own keys:

# Google APIs
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY=YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY_HERE
CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE

# Flask
SECRET_KEY=generate_a_random_string_for_this

Step 5: Populating Your Database
You have two options to add charts:

(Option A) Manual Entry: Run the app (see next step) and navigate to the /manage page. From here, you can create new charts, add layers, and add entries one by one. This is the recommended method for creating original content.

(Option B) Bulk Migration: If you have existing data in the same JSON format as the project's examples, you can:

Create a directory named icebergs in the project root.

Place your .json files inside it.

Run the migration script: python migrate_to_supabase.py.

Step 6: Running Locally
Start the development server:

flask run

The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Step 7: Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)
Push to GitHub: Make sure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository.

Import to Vercel: Go to your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New... > Project," and import your GitHub repository.

Configure Environment Variables: In the Vercel project settings, go to Settings > Environment Variables. Add all the same keys and values from your .env file.

Deploy: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application using the vercel.json file. Your site will be live in minutes!

📖 How to Use the App
Homepage: Browse charts by AI-generated categories or use the search bar to get AI-powered recommendations for a specific topic.

Iceberg Page: Click on any entry to get a detailed explanation and a relevant image. If you don't like the image, click the refresh icon on the image to get a new one.

Management Panel (/manage):

Add or delete entire iceberg charts.

Edit a chart to manage its layers and entries.

Important: After adding new charts, click the "Categorize New Charts" button. This will run the one-time AI process to assign categories to your new charts so they appear correctly on the homepage.
